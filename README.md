## COVID-19 Dataset Analysis and Prediction
  This repository contains the analysis and prediction of COVID-19 based on a dataset of patients. This project aims to explore, clean, and visualize the dataset and build machine-learning models to predict the likelihood of a person contracting COVID-19 based on various features.

## Dataset Description
  The dataset contains several features of patients and their COVID-19 status. These features include personal characteristics like age, gender, and health indicators that can help predict whether a person has COVID-19. The target variable is has_covid, a binary classification (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

## Columns in the Dataset:
  age: Age of the patient (numeric).
  gender: Gender of the patient (categorical - Male/Female).
  has_covid: Target variable indicating if the patient has COVID (binary - 0 = No, 1 = Yes).
  region: Region or country of the patient (categorical).
  other features: Additional features like health status, symptoms, etc.

## Problem Statement
  The main objective of this project is to:
  Explore the relationship between various features and COVID-19.
  Handle missing values and outliers.
  Visualize the data to better understand trends and distributions.
  Build machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a patient having COVID-19.

## Dataset Source
  The dataset used for this analysis is hypothetical and can be downloaded from [Insert dataset link if available or remove this section].

## Technologies Used
  Python: Programming language used for data analysis and model building.
  Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
  NumPy: Library for numerical operations.
  Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
  Scikit-learn: For building machine learning models and preprocessing.

## Steps for Running the Project
  Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and data preprocessing.
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the data to identify trends and patterns.
  Feature Engineering: Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features.
  Modeling: Train machine learning models like Logistic Regression and fine-tune using GridSearchCV.
  Prediction: Make predictions using the trained models and evaluate accuracy.

## Visualization
  The project includes various visualizations to better understand the data, including:
  Count plots: To show the distribution of COVID cases.
  Histograms: For distribution of numerical features like age.
  Heatmaps: To visualize correlations between features.
  Boxplots: To analyze feature distribution with respect to COVID status.


## Results
  The model achieves an accuracy of 85% (you can change based on your results).
  Visualizations reveal patterns such as age and gender distribution among COVID-positive cases.
